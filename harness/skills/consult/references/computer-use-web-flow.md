# Manual Web UI Fallback

Use this only when the normal `agbrowse web-ai` path is blocked by login, MFA, CAPTCHA, provider UI drift, or an explicit user-approved exception.

## Preconditions

- `.consult/consult-packet.md` exists and has been reviewed for secrets.
- `.consult/chatgpt-web-prompt.md` or `.consult/chatgpt-upload-instructions.md` exists.
- The user is available to complete login, MFA, CAPTCHA, or other security prompts.

## Allowed

- Operate the visible ChatGPT web UI with user-approved manual browser control.
- Paste the prepared prompt or upload `.consult/consult-packet.md`.
- Ask the user to complete security challenges.
- Copy the final answer through the visible UI and save it with `scripts/save_clipboard_response.py`.

## Not Allowed

- OpenAI API calls.
- Private or unofficial ChatGPT endpoints.
- Token, cookie, local storage, or browser profile extraction.
- Hosted browsers, stealth, reverse proxies, CAPTCHA bypass, or rate-limit bypass.
- Developer tools or network-panel scraping.

## Steps

1. Explain why `agbrowse` could not complete the workflow.
2. Open ChatGPT in a normal visible browser session.
3. Prefer the Work project if it is visible. If it is not visible, mark project selection as `[UNVERIFIED]`.
4. Select GPT-5.6 High, Extra High, or Pro according to the main session's chosen quality tier. If the exact selection is unavailable, stop; do not fall back to Instant.
5. Paste `.consult/chatgpt-web-prompt.md` or upload `.consult/consult-packet.md` and paste `.consult/chatgpt-upload-instructions.md`.
6. Wait until the response is complete.
7. Copy the final answer with the visible copy control.
8. Save it:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/save_clipboard_response.py \
  --output .consult/consult-response.md
```

After saving, follow `references/after-advice.md`.
